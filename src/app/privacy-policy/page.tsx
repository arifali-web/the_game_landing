            Products, (b) register to use the App, (c) open an account or use any of Our Services, or (d) contact Us for

            mobile number, (d) Your date of birth and other registration information including but not limited to Your

            You may still be subject to certain passive data collection (Passive Data Collection). Such Passive Data
            Collection may include through cookies, as described below, IP address information, location information,
            and certain br/owser data, such as history and/or session information.<br/><br/>Purchases Information<br/><br/>If
            You decide to purchase any of our Services, we will process Your payment information and retain this
            securely for the prevention of fraud and for audit/tax purposes.<br/><br/>The Game App uses automated
            decisions to prevent fraudulent payment transactions being processed as part of its anti-fraud procedures.
            To do this, our systems check payment transactions for behavior that indicates br/eaches of our Terms and
            Conditions of Use. If a transaction meets certain criteria that demonstrate that the Terms and Conditions of
            Use are likely to have been br/eached and the transaction is likely to be fraudulent, the relevant
            transaction may automatically be blocked. Where a transaction is blocked, the user will be notified that
            their transaction cannot be processed.<br/><br/>Geolocation Information<br/><br/>If You have given The Game App
            access to Your location in Your device settings, when You use Your mobile, we will collect information about
            WiFi access points as well as other location information about Your longitude and latitude and may save Your
            device&rsquo;s coordinates to offer certain features to You. This information helps us identify Your
            physical location and we use it to personalise the App and make it easier for You to interact with other
            Users, by enabling the general locality information to be displayed to Users seeing Your profile and showing
            You the profiles of other Users who are near You.<br/><br/>The Game App offers you the option to select your
            location while using the App and check the nearby Users.<br/><br/>Nearby feature: this feature allows You to
            check other Users in nearby venues to Your location and the users who checked in these venues so You can
            reach out to meet.<br/><br/>Live Meeting: The Game App allows you to check in in a place and the Game App
            would act as a radar to notify You which Users are around your checked in location, so Users can reach out
            to each other&rsquo;s for a live meeting. Be careful! No one would approach you in person without your
            consent. You can report if the opposite occurs.<br/><br/>Device and Photos Information<br/><br/>We may collect
            information about Your device when You use the App including the unique device identifier, device model, and
            operating system, for several purposes, as set out in this policy. In addition, if You permit us to do so,
            the App may access Your device&rsquo;s address book solely to add someone to Your contacts.<br/><br/>We also
            collect data about Your photos, such as which are the photos that users spend time on or which are the
            photos that have the best lighting, etc. We may use that data to rearrange Your profile photos aiming to
            position them in a way that is favorable to You. You may opt-out of this feature through our app
            settings.<br/><br/>Links<br/><br/>We may keep track of how You interact with links available on The Game App
            including third party services by redirecting clicks or through other means. We may share aggregate click
            statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.<br/><br/>Other Collected
            Information<br/><br/>We may collect data other than the ones mentioned in these Privacy Policy such as Your
            hobbies, country of origin, country of residence, height, weight, hair color, eye color, favorite cuisine,
            diet, relationship status, religious beliefs, geolocation data, metadata, etc.<br/><br/>Cookies and Similar
            Technologies<br/><br/>(a) Like most online services and websites, We may use Cookies and other technologies,
            such as web beacons, web storage, and unique advertising identifiers, to collect information about Your

            password); (iii) performance: We use these Cookies to collect information about how You interact with Our
            Services and to help Us improve them (For example: to determine if You have interacted with a certain page);
            (iv) analytics: We use these Cookies to help Us improve Our Services (For example: to learn more about which
            features are the most popular with Our users and which ones might need some tweaks); and, (v) advertising:
            We use these Cookies to deliver advertisements, to make them more relevant and meaningful to consumers, and

            websites.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Use of Information<br/><br/>We use the information discussed above in a number of
            ways, such as: (a) processing applications and transactions, (b) verifying Your identity (such as when You

            and enforcing applicable legal requirements, relevant industry standards, contractual obligations and Our
            policies and (l) for any other purposes that We may specifically disclose at the time You provide or We
            collect Your information.<br/><br/>We may also use data that We collect on an aggregate or anonymous basis

            required by law (for example for regulatory purposes).<br/><br/>We take reasonable steps to ensure that the
            personal information We process is limited to what We require in connection with the purposes set out in
            this Privacy Policy; it is accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; and it is erased or rectified
            without delay if it is inaccurate. From time to time, We may ask You to confirm the accuracy of Your
            personal information.<br/><br/>The Game App, its Group Company, or service providers may transfer information

            for maintaining the secrecy of Your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to
            emails between You and The Game App, at all times. &nbsp;<br/>Service Providers<br/><br/>We engage certain
            trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us (&ldquo;Service Providers&rdquo;). The
            suppliers with which The Game App shares User personal data vary depending on a variety of factors, such as
            which of our App, Sites and services a User engages with.<br/><br/>To provide our services to Users, we use
            the following suppliers:<br/><br/>Billing services &ndash; to allow customers to purchase paid features of our
            App (for example, Stripe);<br/>Authentication services &ndash; to allow customers to authenticate their
            Account;<br/>Social media providers &ndash; to allow customers to create/connect their Account with their
            account(s) on such platforms;<br/>Product improvement and market research &ndash; we use third party
            platforms and agencies to carry out customer surveys and market research to improve our products and
            services;<br/>IT services &ndash; some of the third-party software providers used in the operation of our
            business may process Users&rsquo; personal data.<br/><br/>We carry out due diligence on all Service Providers
            we engage to ensure they have adequate data protection and information security measures in place and only
            provide them with the personal data necessary to the service they are providing. Measures are taken to
            ensure that the data shared is non-attributable to the greatest extent possible and our suppliers are also
            subject to extensive obligations under our contractual arrangements, including strict data retention
            limits.<br/><br/>Marketing Services Providers<br/><br/>We partner with providers of marketing services (such as
            Facebook for example) (&ldquo;Marketing Services Providers&rdquo;) to help us market and advertise our App
            and services on third party websites and applications and measure the effectiveness of our advertising
            campaigns. For example:<br/><br/>to exclude You from advertising campaigns aimed at finding new users, if You
            already have an Account;<br/>to show the Game App adverts to users who have visited The Game App App/Sites
            but haven&rsquo;t yet created an Account;<br/>to create an audience for our advertisements of other potential
            users who have similar characteristics to You based on the information the Marketing Service Providers holds
            about You; or<br/>to include You in a &lsquo;custom audience&rsquo; that will receive the Game App
            advertising content (a custom audience is essentially a list of people who we think are most likely to be
            interested in a particular advertisement).<br/><br/>We share a limited amount of Your personal data with these
            Marketing Services Providers, such as:<br/><br/>the advertising identifier associated with Your device (this
            is a random number assigned by Your mobile device manufacturer (for example Apple or Google) to Your device
            to help advertisers (including the manufacturer) know when an ad has been viewed or clicked in an app, and
            when an ad causes a &lsquo;conversion&rsquo; (for example, downloading the app advertised to You));<br/>Your
            estimated location (based on Your IP address);<br/>age and gender;<br/>data about Your visit to our Sites or
            App and action taken on those (for example if You downloaded our App, created an account with our App, or
            details of any purchases made on Site or in App), and<br/>a hashed version of Your email address (to create
            &lsquo;custom audiences&rsquo;).<br/><br/>In some cases, these third parties will also use the data that they
            collect for their own purposes, for example they may aggregate Your data with other data they hold and use
            this to inform advertising related services provided to other clients.<br/><br/>Your rights related to Your
            Personal Data<br/><br/>6.1. You have the right to:&nbsp;<br/><br/>Request access to Your Personal Data. This
            enables You to receive a copy, upon Your request, of the Personal Data we hold about You and to check that
            we are lawfully processing it.<br/>Request correction of the Personal Data that we hold about You. Upon Your
            request, this enables You to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about You
            corrected.<br/>Request erasure of Your Personal Data. This enables You to ask us to delete or remove Personal
            Data where there is no legal requirement for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us
            to delete or remove Your Personal Data where You have exercised Your right to object to
            processing.<br/>Object to processing of Your Personal Data. This right exists where we are relying on a
            Legitimate Interest as the legal basis for our processing and there is something about Your situation, which
            makes You want to object to processing on this ground.<br/>Request the restriction of processing of Your
            Personal Data. This enables You to ask us to suspend the processing of Personal Data about You, for example
            if You want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.<br/>Request the transfer of Your
            Personal Data. We will provide to You, or a third party You have chosen, Your Personal Data in a structured,
            commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which You
            initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with
            You.<br/>Consent Withdrawal. This right only exists where we are relying on consent to process Your Personal
            Data. If You withdraw Your consent, we may not be able to provide You with access to the certain specific
            functionalities of our Platform. We will advise You if this is the case at the time You withdraw Your
            consent.<br/><br/>6.2. How to exercise Your rights:<br/><br/>If You want to exercise any of the rights described
            above, please contact us using the contact details shown in clause 12 below. Typically, You will not have to
            pay a fee to access Your Personal Data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, except in relation
            to Consent Withdrawal, we may charge a reasonable fee if Your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or
            excessive, or, we may refuse to comply with Your request in these circumstances. We may need to request
            specific information from You to help us confirm Your identity and ensure Your right to access Your Personal
            Data (or to exercise any of Your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Data is
            not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact You to ask You for further
            information in relation to Your request to speed up our response. We try to respond to all legitimate
            requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if Your request is particularly
            complex or You have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify You and keep You
            updated.<br/><br/>Data retention and Deletion<br/><br/>We keep Your personal information only as long as we need
            it for the legal basis relied upon and as permitted by applicable law.&nbsp;<br/><br/>When Your Account is
            deleted, we make sure it is no longer viewable in the App. For up to 28 days, it is still possible to
            restore Your Account if it was accidentally deleted. After 28 days, we begin the process of deleting Your
            personal information from our systems, unless:<br/><br/>we must keep it to comply with applicable law (for
            instance, if You make purchases within the App, some personal data may be kept for tax and accounting
            purposes);<br/>we must keep it to evidence our compliance with applicable law (for example, if an account is
            blocked, we keep some account information and a record of the behavior that led to the block - this
            information is retained for evidential purposes in case of queries or legal claims concerning the
            block);<br/>there is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep the relevant information
            until it is resolved; or<br/>the information must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as
            fraud prevention and enhancing Users&rsquo; safety and security (for example, information may need to be
            kept preventing a user who was banned for unsafe behavior or security incidents from opening a new
            account).<br/>Warning: Even after You remove information from Your profile or delete Your Account, copies of
            that information may still be viewable and/or accessed to the extent such information has been previously
            shared with others or copied or stored by others. We cannot control this, nor do we accept any liability for
            this. If You have given third party applications or websites access to Your personal information, they may
            retain such information to the extent permitted under their terms of service or privacy
            policies.<br/><br/>Children Privacy<br/><br/>The Game App does not knowingly collect or solicit any information
