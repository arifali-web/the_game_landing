          how the Game App collects, uses, and shares Your personal data, please check out our Privacy Policy [INSERT
          HYPERLINK].<br /><br />By using the Game App, You acknowledge that we may use such data in accordance with
          our&nbsp;Privacy Policy [INSERT HYPERLINK].<br /><br />Purchase of Memberships and Payment Terms<br /><br />The Game
          App may offer products and services for purchase on the App (&ldquo;In-App Purchase&rdquo;). If You choose
          to make an In-App Purchase, You acknowledge and agree that additional terms, disclosed to You at the point
          of purchase, may apply, and that such additional terms are incorporated herein by reference.&nbsp;<br /><br />If
          You choose to make an in app purchase, You will be prompted to confirm Your purchase with the applicable
          payment provider, and Your method of payment (be it Your card or a third party account such as the Google
          Play Store or App Store (&ldquo;Payment Method&rdquo;) will be charged for the in app purchase at the prices
          displayed to You for the service(s) You&apos;ve selected as well as any sales or similar taxes that may be
          imposed on Your payments, and You authorize the Game App or the third party account, as applicable, to
          charge You.<br /><br />Subscriptions and Auto-Renewal:&nbsp;the Game App may offer some services as
          automatically-renewing subscriptions.&nbsp;IF YOU PURCHASE AN AUTOMATICALLY RENEWING SUBSCRIPTION, YOUR
          SUBSCRIPTION WILL RENEW AT THE END OF THE PERIOD, UNLESS YOU CANCEL, AT THE GAME APP&rsquo;S THEN-CURRENT
          PRICE FOR SUCH SUBSCRIPTIONS.&nbsp;To avoid charges for a new subscription period, You must cancel, as
          described below, before the end of the then-current subscription period. Deleting Your account or deleting
          the application from Your device does not cancel Your subscription. You will be given notice of changes in
          the pricing of the Services to which You have subscribed and an opportunity to cancel. If the Game App
          changes these prices and You do not cancel Your subscription, You agree that You will be charged at the Game
          App&rsquo;s then-current pricing for subscription.<br /><br />Cancelling Subscriptions.&nbsp;If You purchased a
          subscription directly from the Game App, You may cancel or change Your Payment Method via the payment
          settings option. If You purchased a subscription through a Third Party Store, such as the Apple App Store or
          the Google Play Store, You will need to access Your account with that Third Party Store and follow
          instructions to change or cancel Your subscription. If You cancel Your subscription, You may use Your
          subscription until the end of the period You last paid for, but (i) You will not be eligible for a prorated
          refund, (ii) Your subscription will not be renewed when that period expires and (iii) You will then no
          longer be able to use the Services or In-App Purchases enabled by Your subscription.<br /><br />Because our
          Services may be utilised without a subscription, canceling Your subscription does not remove Your profile
          from our Services. If You wish to fully terminate Your account, You must terminate Your account as set forth
          in these Terms.<br /><br />The Game App operates a global business, and our pricing varies by a number of
          factors. We frequently offer promotional rates - which can vary based on region, length of subscription,
          bundle size and more. We also regularly test new features and payment options. The Game App reserves the
          right, including without prior notice, to limit the available quantity of or discontinue making available
          any product, feature, service or other offering; to impose conditions on the honouring of any coupon,
          discount, offer or other promotion; to bar any User from making any transaction; and to refuse to provide
          any User with any product, service or other offering or to honour any offer.<br /><br />Free Trials.&nbsp;If You
          sign up for a free trial and do not cancel, Your trial may convert into a paid subscription and Your Payment
          Method will be charged at the then-current price for such subscription. Once Your free trial converts to a
          paid subscription, Your paid subscription will continue to automatically renew at the end of each period,
          and Your Payment Method will be charged, until You cancel. To avoid charges for a new subscription period,
          You must cancel before the end of the then-current subscription period or free trial period as described
          above. Deleting Your account or deleting the application from Your device does not cancel Your free trial.
          If You have signed up for a free trial on the Game App through the Apple Store or Google Play Store
          previously, You will not be eligible for another free trial and You will then be automatically signed up to
          a subscription and charged as described in this paragraph.<br /><br />Refunds. The Game App does not provide any
          kind of refunds and does not apply any refund policy and and there are no refunds or credits for partially
          used periods.<br /><br />Taxes<br /><br />The payments required under this section do not include any sales tax
          that may be due in connection with the Services provided under these Terms. If the Game App determines it
          has a legal obligation to collect sales tax from You in connection with these Terms, the Game App will
          collect such sales tax in addition to the payments required under this section. If any Services, under these
          Terms are subject to any sales tax in any jurisdiction and You have not remitted the applicable sales tax to
          the , You will be responsible for the payment of such Sales Tax and any related penalties or interest to the
          relevant tax authority. As used herein, &ldquo;Sales Tax&rdquo; means any sales or use tax and any other tax
          measured by sales proceeds that is the functional equivalent of a sales tax where the applicable taxing
          jurisdiction does not otherwise impose a sales or use tax.<br /><br />Disclaimers<br /><br />THE GAME APP PROVIDES

          causes of action which are br/ought against us without Your prior consent. If we ask, You will co-operate
          fully and reasonably as required by us in the defence of any relevant claim.&nbsp;<br /><br />The foregoing
          provision does not require You to indemnify the Game App for any unconscionable commercial practice or any
          fraud, deception, false promise, misrepresentation or concealment, suppression or omission of any material
          fact in connection with the App.<br /><br />Claims of Copyright Infringement<br /><br />If You believe any content

          service provider to contact You, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic
          mail;&nbsp;<br />A statement that You have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner
          complained of is not authorised by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and&nbsp;<br />A statement
          that, under penalty of perjury, the information in the notification is accurate and You are authorised to
          act on behalf of the owner of the exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.&nbsp;<br /><br />Third party
          Services<br /><br />The Service may contain advertisements and promotions offered by third parties and links to
          other web sites or resources. The Game App is not responsible for the availability (or lack of availability)
          of such external websites or resources. If You choose to interact with the third parties made available
          through our Service, such party&apos;s terms will govern their relationship with You. The Game App is not
          responsible or liable for such third parties&apos; terms or actions.<br /><br />Third Party App Store<br /><br />The
          following additional terms and conditions apply to You if You download the App from a Third Party Store. To
          the extent that the other terms and conditions of these Terms are less restrictive than, or otherwise
          conflict with, the terms and conditions of this Section, the more restrictive or conflicting terms and
          conditions in this Section will apply, but solely with respect to the App and the Third Party Store. You
          acknowledge and agree that:<br /><br />These Terms are concluded solely between You and the Game App and not
          with the providers of the Third Party Store, and the Game App (and not the Third Party Store providers) is
          solely responsible for the App and the content thereof. To the extent that these Terms provide for usage
          rules for the App which are less restrictive or in conflict with the applicable terms of service of the
          Third Party Store from which You obtain the App, the more restrictive or conflicting term of the Third Party
          Store will take precedence and will apply.<br />The Third Party Store provider has no obligation whatsoever to
          provide any maintenance and support services with respect to the App. The Game App is solely responsible for
          any product warranties, whether express or implied by law, to the extent not effectively disclaimed. The
          Third Party Store provider will have no warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App, and any
          other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any
          warranty will be the sole responsibility of the Game App.<br />The Game App, not the Third Party Store
          provider, is responsible for addressing any claims You or any third party may have relating to the App or
          Your possession and/or use of the App, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any
          claim that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; (iii) claims arising
          under consumer protection or similar legislation; and/or (iv) intellectual property infringement
          claims.<br />The Third Party Store provider and its subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of these Terms,
          and, upon Your acceptance of these Terms, the Third Party Store provider from whom You obtained the App will
          have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against You as a third
          party beneficiary thereof.<br /><br />In the event of a conflict between a Third Party Store&rsquo;s or mobile
          carrier&rsquo;s applicable terms and conditions and these Terms, the terms and conditions of the Third Party
          Store or mobile carrier shall govern and control. We are not responsible and have no liability whatsoever
          for third-party goods or services You obtain through a Third Party Store or mobile carrier. We encourage You
          to make whatever investigation You feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online
          transaction with any of these third parties.<br /><br />Governing Law and Arbitration<br /><br />Governing Law. Any
          dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be governed by, construed and enforced in accordance
          with the laws of the United Kingdom notwithstanding any conflict of law provisions. Any controversy or claim
          arising out of or relating to these Terms, or the br/each thereof, or Your use of the Service, other than a
          controversy or claim relating to the validity or enforcement of Intellectual Property rights, shall be
          settled by arbitration as set out in these Terms.<br /><br />Arbitration. Please read the following arbitration
          agreement in this Section (&ldquo;Arbitration Agreement&rdquo;) carefully. This Agreement requires You and
          the Game App to resolve disputes by binding arbitration instead of in court and limits the way we may seek
          relief from each other.<br /><br />Application of this Arbitration Agreement.&nbsp;This Arbitration Agreement
          applies to any disputes or claims of any kind whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, statute,
          regulation, ordinance, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal or equitable theory) between You and the
          Game App arising out of or relating to the Terms, prior versions of the Terms, Your use of our App, or any
          other aspect of Your relationship with the Game App, including claims or disputes arising (but not actually
          filed in arbitration) before the effective date of these Terms. It requires that, and by entering into these
          Terms You and the Game App agree, that such disputes or claims will be resolved by binding arbitration,
          rather than in court, except that (i) You or the Game App may assert individual claims in small claims court
          if Your claims qualify; and (ii) You or the Game App may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or
          misuse of intellectual property rights.<br />Notice of Dispute.&nbsp;Before beginning the arbitration
          process, You and the Game App agree to first notify one another of the dispute in writing at least 60 days
          in advance of initiating an arbitration. Notice to the game App must be sent by letter to our registered
          office: 15 Hanover Square, London, United Kingdom.<br /><br />You must provide Your name, current email address,
          mailing address, and telephone number, as well as the name, email address, and telephone number associated
          with You&rsquo;re the Game App (if different from Your current information); and describe the nature of the
          claim and the specific relief being sought.<br /><br />You and the Game App agree to meet and confer, via
          teleconference or videoconference, in a good faith effort to informally resolve any claim or dispute covered
          by this Arbitration Agreement. If either party is represented by counsel, that counsel may participate in
          the informal dispute resolution conference. During this process, You may be provided with an offer of
          judgment. A party defending against a claim may serve on an opposing party an offer to allow judgment on
          specified terms, with the costs then accrued. If the judgment that the offeree finally obtains is not more
          favourable than the unaccepted offer, the offeree must pay the costs incurred after the offer was
          made.<br /><br />All offers, promises, conduct, and statements made in the course of the informal dispute
          resolution process by any party, its agents, employees, and attorneys are confidential and not admissible
          for any purpose in any subsequent proceeding, provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or
          discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the informal
          dispute resolution process.<br /><br />The informal dispute resolution conference shall occur within 60 days of
          receipt of the written notice described above, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon. If, after
          participating in that conference, the parties are unable to resolve the dispute, the claimant may commence
          an arbitration in accordance with this Agreement. Completion of this informal dispute resolution is a
          condition precedent to filing any demand for arbitration. Failure to do so is a br/each of this Agreement,
          and no demand for arbitration shall be valid unless such written notice is provided and good faith
          discussions have been conducted.<br />Any statute of limitations will be tolled while the parties engage in
          the informal dispute resolution process described in this section.<br /><br />Initiation of the Arbitration
          Process.&nbsp;If You and the Game App are unable to resolve the dispute within 60 days, either party may
          proceed to file a claim for arbitration. To begin the arbitration process, You or the Game App must submit
          notice by certified mail of the claim with an individualised arbitration demand. To be valid, the demand
          must contain the name of the claiming party (You or the Game App), Your or the Game App&rsquo;s mailing
          address, the email address or phone number associated with You&rsquo;re the Game App account (if
          applicable), and a detailed description of the dispute and the relief sought. Notice to the Game App must be
          submitted to our registered office: 15 Hanover Square, London, United Kingdom.<br /><br />Arbitration Rules. The
          London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA) rules governs this Arbitration Agreement and applies to the
          interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.&nbsp;<br /><br />The initiating party must pay all
          filing fees for the arbitration. Your and the Game App responsibility to pay other administrative and
          arbitrator costs will be as set forth in the applicable arbitration provider&rsquo;s rules, unless the
          arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. If a claim is determined to be frivolous, the claimant is
          responsible for reimbursing the respondent for its portion of all such administrative, hearing, and/or other
          fees incurred as a result of the frivolous claim.<br /><br />Arbitration Decision.&nbsp;The arbitrator has the
          exclusive authority to resolve any and all threshold arbitrability issues, including whether this
          Arbitration Agreement is applicable, enforceable, or unconscionable. Courts, however, shall have the
          exclusive authority to determine (i) whether any provision of this Arbitration Agreement should be severed
          and the consequences of said severance, (ii) whether You have complied with conditions precedent to
          arbitration, and (iii) whether an arbitration provider is available to hear the arbitration(s) under these
          Terms. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The
          arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief
          available in an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum&rsquo;s rules, and the Terms (including
          the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing
          the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages
          awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief that a judge in a court of law would have.
          The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon You and us.<br />No Jury Trials.&nbsp;By agreeing to
          arbitration, YOU AND THE GAME APP ARE EACH AGREEING TO WAIVE THEIR RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL. Instead, You and
          the Game App are electing that all claims and disputes will be resolved by arbitration under this
          Arbitration Agreement. An arbitrator can award the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this
          Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an
          arbitration award is subject to very limited review.<br /><br />Class Waiver. All claims and disputes within the
          scope of this Arbitration Agreement MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR
          COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND YOU AND THE GAME APP GIVE UP YOUR RIGHTS TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR ANY OTHER
          CLASS PROCEEDING. However, this shall not preclude the use of bellwether arbitrations, global mediation, nor
          preclude the application of the arbitration provider&rsquo;s fee schedules for mass arbitrations, as
          applicable. Only relief that would be permitted in an individual lawsuit is available, and claims of more
          than one customer or User cannot be arbitrated or consolidated with those of any other customer or User, nor
          shall this preclude application of the arbitration provider&rsquo;s fee schedules, as applicable. The
          arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or
          parties, nor shall this preclude application of the arbitration provider&rsquo;s fee
          schedules.</p>
